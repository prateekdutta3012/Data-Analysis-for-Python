# Data-Analysis-for-Python

Data Analysis has been around for a long time. But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

Big Data includes everything – texts, emails, tweets, user searches (on search engines), social media chatter, data generated from IoT and connected devices – basically, everything we do online. The data generated every day via the digital world is so vast and complex that traditional data processing and analysis systems cannot handle it. Enter Data Science and Data Analytics. 

Since Big Data, Data Science, and Data Analytics are emerging technologies (they’re still evolving), we often use Data Science and Data Analytics interchangeably. The confusion primarily arises from the fact that both Data Scientists and Data Analysts work with Big Data. Even so, the difference between Data Analyst and Data Scientist is stark, fuelling the Data Science vs. Data Analytics debate. 

Data Science and Data Analytics deal with Big Data, each taking a unique approach. Data Science is an umbrella that encompasses Data Analytics. Data Science is a combination of multiple disciplines – Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

It includes concepts like data mining, data inference, predictive modeling, and ML algorithm development, to extract patterns from complex datasets and transform them into actionable business strategies. On the other hand, data analytics is mainly concerned with Statistics, Mathematics, and Statistical Analysis. 

Data Scientists and Data Analysts utilize data in different ways. Data Scientists use a combination of Mathematical, Statistical, and Machine Learning techniques to clean, process, and interpret data to extract insights from it. They design advanced data modeling processes using prototypes, ML algorithms, predictive models, and custom analysis. 

While data analysts examine data sets to identify trends and draw conclusions, Data Analysts collect large volumes of data, organize it, and analyze it to identify relevant patterns. After the analysis part is done, they strive to present their findings through data visualization methods like charts, graphs, etc. Thus, Data Analysts transform the complex insights into business-savvy language that both technical and non-technical members of an organization can understand. 

The course reviews some basic Python concepts, and visualization:

how to read data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel)
how to clean and transform data using NumPy and Pandas
how to visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn
how to process data to create reports.
